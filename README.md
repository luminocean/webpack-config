You can use this to setup a web project based on webpack quickly.

This project also comes with a dummy little project shows how everything works.

# install dependencies

`npm install webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-merge npm-install-webpack-plugin style-loader css-loader html-webpack-plugin babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev`

If you are developing React, also run:
